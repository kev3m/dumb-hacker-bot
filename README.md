K, not dumb at all but, maybe not effective 🐒

## Inspired by the Infinite Monkey Theorem

Wth is that? The Infinite Monkey Theorem is a proposition that an unlimited number of monkeys, given typewriters and sufficient time, will eventually produce a particular text, such as Hamlet or even the complete works of Shakespeare.

So.. Why not swap typewriters for keyboards, and let these monkeys try to guess a password that changes every 10 seconds?

Considering an infinite space of time, probably someday they will get it right. See you guys in eternity! 💫
